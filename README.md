## What

This is a small script to perform all the tasks that are necessary to create a private/public keypair for 
ssh-authentication for password-less connecting to a remote server. Additionally it performs some checks and 
adjusts file-permissions both locally and on the remote server to avoid some common pitfalls.

## Why

Because I failed every time I tried to do this manually.

## How

### Preconditions

You need to be able to connect to the remote server with ssh and a username and password.

### Grab it

    git clone https://github.com/centic9/generate-and-send-ssh-key.git

### Run it

The script expects some commandline arguments which specify which key should be transferred/created and 
where it should be sent to:

    -u (--user) <username>, default: $USER
    -f (--file) <file>,     default: ~/.ssh/id_test
    -h (--host) <hostname>, default: host
     
    -p (--port)    <port>, default: <default ssh port>
    -k (--keysize) <size>, default: 4096
    -t (--keytype) <type>, default: ed25519 (rsa, ed25519)
    
    -P(--passphrase) <key-passphrase>, default: <empty>

You should at least set `--user`, `--file`, and `--host`.  

    cd generate-and-send-ssh-key
    ./generate-and-send-ssh-key.sh --user bob --host myhost

This will ask for the password of the target host at least once, probably twice, if the permissions are not set correctly yet.

If the key-file does not exist yet, a new key will be generated.

### Enjoy

Now you should be able to connect to the machine via ```ssh -i $FILENAME $USER@$HOST```.  
If you use the filename 
```~/.ssh/id_rsa``` you can omit the "-i" argument to ssh.

## Caveat

This script will remove write access to your home-directory for "group" and "other" on the remote server because 
ssh-public/private key authentication will not work otherwise.  

So if there are processes running as different user, 
writing data to this directory may fail for them after this script is run.
